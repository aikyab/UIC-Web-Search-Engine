<h3>Research</h3>
My research is in visual computing, an area of computer science that handles
images, 3D models, and the interaction between humans and data that can be
represented visually. My research interests go from visual-system
related problems that can be robustly solved through automation, to
problems that require human experts in the computational loop, and the
principles behind this work.

<br><br>
This body of research has been recognized by my peers with a <b>US National
Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER 
Award</b> and by multiple <b>NSF research awards</b> and <b>multi-site NIH
(US National Institutes of Health)  R01 awards</b>, including one as an early-stage
investigator. I have received multiple <b>Oustanding Research
Awards</b> at conferences, including a <b>Test of Time Award</b>,  along with my students. My research has been
featured on journal and newsletter covers. I have co-authored scientific open-source 
software adopted at over forty institutions, from Ghana to Estonia to
Canada, and I am an inventor (a.k.a. patent
co-author) whose ideas have been embedded in a medical device.
  
<br><br>

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science and a faculty member of the
Electronic Visualization 
Laboratory at the University
of Illinois at Chicago. The lab's <a href="http://evl.uic.edu"> research
pages</a> are the best place to learn more about my current work. Prior to
UIC, I was Research Faculty in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie
Mellon University and the founder and director of the Interdisciplinary
Visualization Research Lab in the Rust Belt; the lab's <a href="http://visualizlab.org">
research pages</a> are the best place to learn more about my past work,
my group, our projects, results, publications, courses taught, alumni and
sponsors.

<!--and several
<b>Teaching Awards</b> for courses which blend teaching and research.--->

<!-- I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago as of January 2015. Prior to that, I 
was Research Faculty in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, 
and Joint Assistant Professor in the Department of Computational and Systems 
Biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and Assistant Professor 
at the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Computer Science. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Brown 
University in May 2007. Before that, I was an intern at Philips Research in the Netherlands. And first, I received a M.Sc. and a B.S. in 1998, respectively 1997, from the Computer Science Department of
the Politehnica University of Bucharest in Romania. --->

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>

<a href="http://evl.uic.edu/cs529/">Current teaching
schedule: CS529 Visual Data Science</a></p>

I have received six Teaching Awards for courses that blend teaching and
research; 
although, or perhaps because, 
I often choose to experiment with my teaching and learn from the results. 
My lab's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VisualizLab">teaching 
portfolio</a> showcases some of the work produced by my students.
 <br><br>

<h3>Service and Outreach</h3>
Please see my <a href="./cv_Aug_2021.pdf">CV</a>
for a complete list of professional service and 
outreach activities.
