            The UIC Interactive Campus Map is a rich resource with useful links that enables users to quickly zoom in on the locations of their interest and learn more about UIC. The map utilizes Google’s Maps Application Programming Interface (API) to depict a vast array of key destinations on UIC campus such as dining on campus, transit options, accessibility resources, academic services, cultural centers, financial services, health & wellness, student services and other support programs. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Originally launched in August 2014, the map was most recently redesigned and relaunched in August 2021. This project was a collaboration between two units under the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services: Office of Planning, Sustainability and Project Management (PSPM) and Technology & Building Systems.
